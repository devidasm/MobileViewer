Initial commit.

Overall:
- Right now, simple UI with some basic app functionality. OpenGL ES setup with some framework done for meshes and shaders.

Trackball:
- A bit wonky but it's functional. For now, will leave alone until adding more interaction functionality.

GFX stuff:
- So far, just have a base framework for meshes right now. In reality, spheres are the only mesh to be drawn at the moment. Sufficient for now.
- Shaders are very basic right now (only implemented for spheres, really). Has the following functionality:
  *MVP matrix
  *A color buffer (which the colors are actually the normals of the sphere)

TODO:
- Look into DICOM libraries for Android
- Get 2D textures to work, then move onto 3D textures
- Make some sort of interface that overlays OpenGL ES screen to add switches/scroll bars to add interactivity.
