\section section_Introduction Introduction

Imebra is an open source Dicom library.
The library has been designed to handle Dicom files, but it includes also some
 classes that manage jpeg and other image files.

At the moment the library provides the following features:
- dicom files parser and builder
- jpeg files parser and builder
- image decompression and compression in the following formats:
  - jpeg baseline (8 bits per color channel lossy)
  - jpeg baseline extended (12 bits per color channel lossy)
  - jpeg lossless (up to 16 bits per color channel lossless)
  - raw dicom (up to 16 bits per color channel lossless)
  - rle dicom (up to 16 bits per color channel lossless)
- multi platform
- self contained (the library uses only functions from the standard C library
                  and the standard template library)
- color space conversion
- support for nested datasets (sequences)
- support for Unicode and different Dicom charsets
- DICOMDIR parser and writer
- support for transactions
- load larger tags only when necessary


\section is_not What Imebra does NOT do?

- the library doesn't check for a Dicom stream validity; this feature will be
   introduced with the support for dicom objects.
- the library doesn't support network communication


\section start Where to start

After reading the \ref license_agreement, you should read the \ref quick_tour
 and the section \ref imebra_structure.

A guide that will help you to include Imebra in your project can be
 found in \ref add_to_project.

If you want to build the examples and the test units you should read \ref compile_examples.

A detailed reference of the C++ classes that compose Imebra is included in
 this manual.
